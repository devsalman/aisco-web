<p>Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) is a modeling language based on Delta Oriented Programming (DOP) that supports software development with Software Product Product Line (SPL) approach. By using SPL, software developers can create multiple products on a single development process. At the beginning, developer have to define system commonalities and variabilities. </p>
<p>By using ABS, feature variations can be defined on feature model. Each feature will be realized using delta model (delta). Delta is a code that can change the Core ABS (existing features) without changing the original code. The connectivity between the delta with features, defined in the Product Line Configuration. Finally, to create a product, we have to define the product name and features that will be implemented for the product. ABS compiler will create product selection based on the feature selection. </p>
