<h4 class="mb-30">Problems with Charity Organizations</h4>
<p><strong>Accountability and trust</strong> are still major problems in this non-profitable sector, which are enforced by the key stakeholders: beneficiaries and funders or donors. Moreover, several organizations may deliver the aids to the same receiver or geographical area at the same time. On the other hand, <strong>inadequate fundings for the other areas might happen due to shortcoming coordination</strong>. The web potentially can help the charities to be more transparent and resolve the imbalanced distribution of aids. However, <strong>most of the organizations do not fully adopt the potential of technology</strong> for the aims.</p>
