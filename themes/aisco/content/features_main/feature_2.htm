<h4 class="mb-30">Adaptive Information System for Charity Organizations</h4>
<p>There has been an increasing number of charities worldwide. However, transparency and imbalanced distribution are still critical issues in this sector.

Due to the variability of the organizations, it is not easy to provide a one application-fit-all open source applications. Many small organizations are very active but still lack of qualified resources to provide IT supports.
